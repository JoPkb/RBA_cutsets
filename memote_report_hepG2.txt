        required to maintain all constant processes such as turgor pressure and
        other housekeeping activities. In metabolic models this is expressed by

        The growth-associated maintenance (GAM) term accounts for the energy in
        the form of ATP that is required to synthesize macromolecules such as
        Proteins, DNA and RNA, and other processes during growth. A GAM term is
        therefore a requirement for any well-defined biomass reaction. There are
        different ways to implement this term depending on
        what kind of experimental data is available and the preferred
        way of implementing the biomass reaction:
        - Chemostat growth experiments yield a single GAM value representing the
          required energy per gram of biomass (Figure 6 of [1]_). This can be
          implemented in a lumped biomass reaction or in the final term of a split
          biomass reaction.
        - Experimentally delineating or estimating the GAM requirements
          for each macromolecule separately is possible, yet requires either
          data from multi-omics experiments [2]_ or detailed resources [1]_ ,
          respectively. Individual energy requirements can either be implemented
          in a split biomass equation on the term for each macromolecule, or, on
          the basis of the biomass composition, they can be summed into a single
          GAM value for growth and treated as mentioned above.
    
        This test is only able to detect if a lumped biomass reaction or the final
        term of a split biomass reaction contains this term. Hence, it will
        only detect the use of a single GAM value as opposed to individual energy
        requirements of each macromolecule. Both approaches, however, have
        its merits.
    
        Implementation:
        Determines the metabolite identifiers of ATP, ADP, H2O, HO4P and H+ based
        on an internal mapping table. Checks if ATP and H2O are a subset of the
        reactants and ADP, HO4P and H+ a subset of the products of the biomass
        reaction.

        A single incorrectly defined reaction can lead to stoichiometric
        inconsistency in the model, and consequently to unconserved metabolites.
        Similar to insufficient constraints, this may give rise to cycles which
        either produce mass from nothing or consume mass from the model.

        SBO:0000627 represents the term 'exchange reaction'. The Systems Biology
        Ontology defines an exchange reaction as follows: 'A modeling process to
        provide matter influx or efflux to a model, for example to replenish a
        metabolic network with raw materials (eg carbon / energy sources). Such
        reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not
        have a  physical correspondence. Exchange reactions, often represented as
        'R_EX_', can operate in the negative (uptake) direction or positive
        (secretion) direction. By convention, a negative flux through an exchange
        reaction represents uptake of the corresponding metabolite, and a positive
        flux represent discharge.' Every exchange reaction should be annotated with
        this. Exchange reactions differ from demand reactions in that the
        metabolites are removed from or added to the extracellular
        environment only.
    
        Implementation:
        Check if each exchange reaction has a non-zero "annotation"
        attribute that contains the key "sbo" with the associated
        value being one of the SBO terms above.

        SBO:0000629 represents the term 'biomass production'. The Systems Biology
        Ontology defines an exchange reaction as follows: 'Biomass production,
        often represented 'R_BIOMASS_', is usually the optimization target reaction
        of constraint-based models, and can consume multiple reactants to produce
        multiple products. It is also assumed that parts of the reactants are also
        consumed in unrepresented processes and hence products do not have to
        reflect all the atom composition of the reactants. Formulation of a
        biomass production process entails definition of the macromolecular
        content (eg. cellular protein fraction), metabolic constitution of
        each fraction (eg. amino acids), and subsequently the atomic composition
        (eg. nitrogen atoms). More complex biomass functions can additionally
        incorporate details of essential vitamins and cofactors required for
        growth.'
        Every reaction representing the biomass production should be annotated with
        this.
    
        Implementation:
        Check if each biomass reaction has a non-zero "annotation"
        attribute that contains the key "sbo" with the associated
        value being one of the SBO terms above.
