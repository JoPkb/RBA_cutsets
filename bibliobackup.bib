	abstract = {In early studies on energy metabolism of tumor cells, it was proposed that the enhanced glycolysis was induced by a decreased oxidative phosphorylation. Since then it has been indiscriminately applied to all types of tumor cells that the {ATP} supply is mainly or only provided by glycolysis, without an appropriate experimental evaluation. In this review, the different genetic and biochemical mechanisms by which tumor cells achieve an enhanced glycolytic flux are analyzed. Furthermore, the proposed mechanisms that arguably lead to a decreased oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells are discussed. As the O(2) concentration in hypoxic regions of tumors seems not to be limiting for the functioning of oxidative phosphorylation, this pathway is re-evaluated regarding oxidizable substrate utilization and its contribution to {ATP} supply versus glycolysis. In the tumor cell lines where the oxidative metabolism prevails over the glycolytic metabolism for {ATP} supply, the flux control distribution of both pathways is described. The effect of glycolytic and mitochondrial drugs on tumor energy metabolism and cellular proliferation is described and discussed. Similarly, the energy metabolic changes associated with inherent and acquired resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy of tumor cells, and those determined by positron emission tomography, are revised. It is proposed that energy metabolism may be an alternative therapeutic target for both hypoxic (glycolytic) and oxidative tumors.},

We used cell line-specific {GEMs} to analyze the differences in the metabolism of cancer cell lines and to explore the heterogeneous expression of the metabolic subsystems. Furthermore, we predicted 85 antimetabolites that can inhibit growth of, or even kill, any of the cell lines, while at the same time not being toxic for 83 different healthy human cell types. 60 of these antimetabolites were found to inhibit growth in all cell lines. Finally, we experimentally validated one of the predicted antimetabolites using two cell lines with different phenotypic origins and found that it is effective in inhibiting the growth of these cell lines. Using immunohistochemistry, we also showed high or moderate expression levels of proteins targeted by the validated antimetabolite.

	abstract = {As part of an ongoing study of l-lactate metabolism both in normal and in cancer cells, we investigated whether and how l-lactate metabolism occurs in mitochondria of human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cells. We found that Hep G2 cell mitochondria (Hep G2-M) possess an l-lactate dehydrogenase (ml-{LDH}) restricted to the inner mitochondrial compartments as shown by immunological analysis, confocal microscopy and by assaying ml-{LDH} activity in solubilized mitochondria. Cytosolic and mitochondrial l-{LDHs} were found to differ from one another in their saturation kinetics. Having shown that l-lactate itself can enter Hep G2 cells, we found that Hep G2-M swell in ammonium l-lactate, but not in ammonium pyruvate solutions, in a manner inhibited by mersalyl, this showing the occurrence of a carrier-mediated l-lactate transport in these mitochondria. Occurrence of the l-lactate/pyruvate shuttle and the appearance outside mitochondria of oxaloacetate, malate and citrate arising from l-lactate uptake and metabolism together with the low oxygen consumption and membrane potential generation are in favor of an anaplerotic role for l-{LAC} in Hep G2-M.},

	abstract = {Glucose is a key metabolite used by cancer cells to generate {ATP}, maintain redox state and create biomass. Glucose can be catabolized to lactate in the cytoplasm, which is termed glycolysis, or alternatively can be catabolized to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic heterogeneity exists in a subset of human tumors, with some cells maintaining a glycolytic phenotype while others predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation. Cells within tumors interact metabolically with transfer of catabolites from supporting stromal cells to adjacent cancer cells. The Reverse Warburg Effect describes when glycolysis in the cancer-associated stroma metabolically supports adjacent cancer cells. This catabolite transfer, which induces stromal-cancer metabolic coupling, allows cancer cells to generate {ATP}, increase proliferation, and reduce cell death. Catabolites implicated in metabolic coupling include the monocarboxylates lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies. Monocarboxylate transporters ({MCT}) are critically necessary for release and uptake of these catabolites. {MCT}4 is involved in the release of monocarboxylates from cells, is regulated by catabolic transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha ({HIF}1A) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ({NF}-κB), and is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts. Conversely, {MCT}1 is predominantly involved in the uptake of these catabolites and is highly expressed in a subgroup of cancer cells. {MYC} and {TIGAR}, which are genes involved in cellular proliferation and anabolism, are inducers of {MCT}1. Profiling human tumors on the basis of an altered redox balance and intra-tumoral metabolic interactions may have important biomarker and therapeutic implications. Alterations in the redox state and mitochondrial function of cells can induce metabolic coupling. Hence, there is interest in redox and metabolic modulators as anticancer agents. Also, markers of metabolic coupling have been associated with poor outcomes in numerous human malignancies and may be useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers.},

	abstract = {The field of energy metabolism dramatically progressed in the last decade, owing to a large number of cancer studies, as well as fundamental investigations on related transcriptional networks and cellular interactions with the microenvironment. The concept of metabolic flexibility was clarified in studies showing the ability of cancer cells to remodel the biochemical pathways of energy transduction and linked anabolism in response to glucose, glutamine or oxygen deprivation. A clearer understanding of the large-scale bioenergetic impact of C-{MYC}, {MYCN}, {KRAS} and P53 was obtained, along with its modification during the course of tumor development. The metabolic dialog between different types of cancer cells, but also with the stroma, also complexified the understanding of bioenergetics and raised the concepts of metabolic symbiosis and reverse Warburg effect. Signaling studies revealed the role of respiratory chain-derived reactive oxygen species for metabolic remodeling and metastasis development. The discovery of oxidative tumors in human and mice models related to chemoresistance also changed the prevalent view of dysfunctional mitochondria in cancer cells. Likewise, the influence of energy metabolism-derived oncometabolites emerged as a new means of tumor genetic regulation. The knowledge obtained on the multi-site regulation of energy metabolism in tumors was translated to cancer preclinical studies, supported by genetic proof of concept studies targeting {LDHA}, {HK}2, {PGAM}1, or {ACLY}. Here, we review those different facets of metabolic remodeling in cancer, from its diversity in physiology and pathology, to the search of the genetic determinants, the microenvironmental regulators and pharmacological modulators.},

	abstract = {When the problem of carcinoma is approached from the metabolic aspect, the first question which arises is: how does the metabolism of growing tissue differ from that of resting? The prospects of finding an answer to this question are good. Whether the mass of a given tissue is to remain constant, or, within a short period to increase many-fold, must be determined by the velocity of those processes which supply the driving forces for growth. Our task is to search for such processes and to compare their velocities in resting tissues and growing tissues.If this question is solved, then the further inquiry must be made as to whether the manner of arrangement of growing cells is manifested in their metabolism. Does the metabolism of tumors, growing in a disorganized manner, differ from the metabolism of orderly cells growing at the same rate. The hope of solving this question must be considered slight in general, and rightly so, if it is only the form-building forces which tumors lack. For of all problems of physiology, that of form is the least approachable.Yet it seems doubtful that only minute and unimportant differences should exist between the growth of young cells and those of tumors, instead of considerable physico-chemical differences. Progress in the carcinoma problem implies the adoption of the point of view involved by the latter alternative. This has been done and I shall try to show that it is the correct point of view.},

Energy metabolism is particularly important for growth and genes encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism are frequently altered in cancer cells. A genome scale metabolic model ({GEM}) is a mathematical formalization of metabolism which allows simulation and hypotheses testing of metabolic strategies. It has successfully been applied to many microorganisms and is now used to study cancer metabolism. Generic models of human metabolism have been reconstructed based on the existence of metabolic genes in the human genome. Cancer specific models of metabolism have also been generated by reducing the number of reactions in the generic model based on high throughput expression data, e.g. transcriptomics and proteomics. Targets for drugs and bio markers for diagnostics have been identified using these models. They have also been used as scaffolds for analysis of high throughput data to allow mechanistic interpretation of changes in expression. Finally, {GEMs} allow quantitative flux predictions using flux balance analysis ({FBA}). Here we critically review the requirements for successful {FBA} simulations of cancer cells and discuss the symmetry between the methods used for modeling of microbial and cancer metabolism. {GEMs} have great potential for translational research on cancer and will therefore become of increasing importance in the future.},

	abstract = {Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, {MutSigCV}, for resolving the problem. We apply {MutSigCV} to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with {DNA} replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, {MutSigCV} is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

	abstract = {Cancer cells have fundamentally altered cellular metabolism that is associated with their tumorigenicity and malignancy. In addition to the widely studied Warburg effect, several new key metabolic alterations in cancer have been established over the last decade, leading to the recognition that altered tumor metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Deciphering the full scope and functional implications of the dysregulated metabolism in cancer requires both the advancement of a variety of omics measurements and the advancement of computational approaches for the analysis and contextualization of the accumulated data. Encouragingly, while the metabolic network is highly interconnected and complex, it is at the same time probably the best characterized cellular network. Following, this review discusses the challenges that genome-scale modeling of cancer metabolism has been facing. We survey several recent studies demonstrating the first strides that have been done, testifying to the value of this approach in portraying a network-level view of the cancer metabolism and in identifying novel drug targets and biomarkers. Finally, we outline a few new steps that may further advance this field.},

	abstract = {Cancer cells reprogram metabolism to support rapid proliferation and survival. Energy metabolism is particularly important for growth and genes encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism are frequently altered in cancer cells. A genome scale metabolic model ({GEM}) is a mathematical formalization of metabolism which allows simulation and hypotheses testing of metabolic strategies. It has successfully been applied to many microorganisms and is now used to study cancer metabolism. Generic models of human metabolism have been reconstructed based on the existence of metabolic genes in the human genome. Cancer specific models of metabolism have also been generated by reducing the number of reactions in the generic model based on high throughput expression data, e.g. transcriptomics and proteomics. Targets for drugs and bio markers for diagnostics have been identified using these models. They have also been used as scaffolds for analysis of high throughput data to allow mechanistic interpretation of changes in expression. Finally, {GEMs} allow quantitative flux predictions using flux balance analysis ({FBA}). Here we critically review the requirements for successful {FBA} simulations of cancer cells and discuss the symmetry between the methods used for modeling of microbial and cancer metabolism. {GEMs} have great potential for translational research on cancer and will therefore become of increasing importance in the future.},

	abstract = {Predicting resource allocation between cell processes is the primary step towards decoding the evolutionary constraints governing bacterial growth under various conditions. Quantitative prediction at genome-scale remains a computational challenge as current methods are limited by the tractability of the problem or by simplifying hypotheses. Here, we show that the constraint-based modeling method Resource Balance Analysis ({RBA}), calibrated using genome-wide absolute protein quantification data, accurately predicts resource allocation in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis for a wide range of growth conditions. The regulation of most cellular processes is consistent with the objective of growth rate maximization except for a few suboptimal processes which likely integrate more complex objectives such as coping with stressful conditions and survival. As a proof of principle by using simulations, we illustrated how calibrated {RBA} could aid rational design of strains for maximizing protein production, offering new opportunities to investigate design principles in prokaryotes and to exploit them for biotechnological applications.},

While both methods have been proven to deliver useful extensions of metabolic models, they may considerably increase size and complexity of the models and there is currently no tool available to fully automate generation and calibration of such enzyme-constrained models from given stoichiometric models.},

In this review, we describe, analyze, and strive to reconstruct the regulatory networks of several {TRs} acting in the energy metabolism pathways, glycolysis (and its main branching reactions), and oxidative phosphorylation of nonmetastatic and metastatic cancer cells. Moreover, we propose which possible gene targets might allow these {TRs} to facilitate the modulation of each energy metabolism pathway, depending on the tumor microenvironment.},
