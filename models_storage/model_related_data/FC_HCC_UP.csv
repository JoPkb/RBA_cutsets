Metabolic genes consistently upregulated in at least 6 HCC datasets - Total 284,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Classification is as in the list curated by Possemato et al., 2011; Nature. 476(7360):346-50. doi: 10.1038/nature10350. See Supplementary Table (nature10350-s2_Metabolic targets.xls) in the Publication. The pathways were re-classified to simplify grouping. Amino acid* - others besides glutamine, serine that were mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Was not in Possemato's list.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) analysis was performed only for those genes whose expression correlated with progression markers as pre-defined with the TCGA Liver cancer data assessed via cBioPortal.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Genes ""excluded"" from survival analysis were those that: (a) had e.g. two probe ID one significantly upregulated and the other significantly downregulated by almost similar folds, or (b) for other reasons such as not significantly expressed in GSE14520 HCC cohort used for survival analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
p.d. - previously determined to predict survival,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Correlation with progression markers"" - Yes when metabolic gene correlates with at least ECM2 and MMP9 and may in addition correlate with CDH1 and VIM",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tumour size: Small (S) and Large (L); Reference - 5cm. Analysed for genes in the ""Yes"" category.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
*See Table S3 for full result,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Study with on invasion/metastatic phenotypes and or clinical survival associated with the respective gene. Mostly refers to human HCC studies (in vitro and in vivo) or animal studies that also include validation in humans,,,,,,,,,,,,,
