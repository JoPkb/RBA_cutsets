	abstract = {In early studies on energy metabolism of tumor cells, it was proposed that the enhanced glycolysis was induced by a decreased oxidative phosphorylation. Since then it has been indiscriminately applied to all types of tumor cells that the {ATP} supply is mainly or only provided by glycolysis, without an appropriate experimental evaluation. In this review, the different genetic and biochemical mechanisms by which tumor cells achieve an enhanced glycolytic flux are analyzed. Furthermore, the proposed mechanisms that arguably lead to a decreased oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells are discussed. As the O(2) concentration in hypoxic regions of tumors seems not to be limiting for the functioning of oxidative phosphorylation, this pathway is re-evaluated regarding oxidizable substrate utilization and its contribution to {ATP} supply versus glycolysis. In the tumor cell lines where the oxidative metabolism prevails over the glycolytic metabolism for {ATP} supply, the flux control distribution of both pathways is described. The effect of glycolytic and mitochondrial drugs on tumor energy metabolism and cellular proliferation is described and discussed. Similarly, the energy metabolic changes associated with inherent and acquired resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy of tumor cells, and those determined by positron emission tomography, are revised. It is proposed that energy metabolism may be an alternative therapeutic target for both hypoxic (glycolytic) and oxidative tumors.},

We used cell line-specific {GEMs} to analyze the differences in the metabolism of cancer cell lines and to explore the heterogeneous expression of the metabolic subsystems. Furthermore, we predicted 85 antimetabolites that can inhibit growth of, or even kill, any of the cell lines, while at the same time not being toxic for 83 different healthy human cell types. 60 of these antimetabolites were found to inhibit growth in all cell lines. Finally, we experimentally validated one of the predicted antimetabolites using two cell lines with different phenotypic origins and found that it is effective in inhibiting the growth of these cell lines. Using immunohistochemistry, we also showed high or moderate expression levels of proteins targeted by the validated antimetabolite.

	abstract = {As part of an ongoing study of l-lactate metabolism both in normal and in cancer cells, we investigated whether and how l-lactate metabolism occurs in mitochondria of human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cells. We found that Hep G2 cell mitochondria (Hep G2-M) possess an l-lactate dehydrogenase (ml-{LDH}) restricted to the inner mitochondrial compartments as shown by immunological analysis, confocal microscopy and by assaying ml-{LDH} activity in solubilized mitochondria. Cytosolic and mitochondrial l-{LDHs} were found to differ from one another in their saturation kinetics. Having shown that l-lactate itself can enter Hep G2 cells, we found that Hep G2-M swell in ammonium l-lactate, but not in ammonium pyruvate solutions, in a manner inhibited by mersalyl, this showing the occurrence of a carrier-mediated l-lactate transport in these mitochondria. Occurrence of the l-lactate/pyruvate shuttle and the appearance outside mitochondria of oxaloacetate, malate and citrate arising from l-lactate uptake and metabolism together with the low oxygen consumption and membrane potential generation are in favor of an anaplerotic role for l-{LAC} in Hep G2-M.},

	abstract = {Glucose is a key metabolite used by cancer cells to generate {ATP}, maintain redox state and create biomass. Glucose can be catabolized to lactate in the cytoplasm, which is termed glycolysis, or alternatively can be catabolized to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic heterogeneity exists in a subset of human tumors, with some cells maintaining a glycolytic phenotype while others predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation. Cells within tumors interact metabolically with transfer of catabolites from supporting stromal cells to adjacent cancer cells. The Reverse Warburg Effect describes when glycolysis in the cancer-associated stroma metabolically supports adjacent cancer cells. This catabolite transfer, which induces stromal-cancer metabolic coupling, allows cancer cells to generate {ATP}, increase proliferation, and reduce cell death. Catabolites implicated in metabolic coupling include the monocarboxylates lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies. Monocarboxylate transporters ({MCT}) are critically necessary for release and uptake of these catabolites. {MCT}4 is involved in the release of monocarboxylates from cells, is regulated by catabolic transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha ({HIF}1A) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ({NF}-κB), and is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts. Conversely, {MCT}1 is predominantly involved in the uptake of these catabolites and is highly expressed in a subgroup of cancer cells. {MYC} and {TIGAR}, which are genes involved in cellular proliferation and anabolism, are inducers of {MCT}1. Profiling human tumors on the basis of an altered redox balance and intra-tumoral metabolic interactions may have important biomarker and therapeutic implications. Alterations in the redox state and mitochondrial function of cells can induce metabolic coupling. Hence, there is interest in redox and metabolic modulators as anticancer agents. Also, markers of metabolic coupling have been associated with poor outcomes in numerous human malignancies and may be useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers.},

	abstract = {The field of energy metabolism dramatically progressed in the last decade, owing to a large number of cancer studies, as well as fundamental investigations on related transcriptional networks and cellular interactions with the microenvironment. The concept of metabolic flexibility was clarified in studies showing the ability of cancer cells to remodel the biochemical pathways of energy transduction and linked anabolism in response to glucose, glutamine or oxygen deprivation. A clearer understanding of the large-scale bioenergetic impact of C-{MYC}, {MYCN}, {KRAS} and P53 was obtained, along with its modification during the course of tumor development. The metabolic dialog between different types of cancer cells, but also with the stroma, also complexified the understanding of bioenergetics and raised the concepts of metabolic symbiosis and reverse Warburg effect. Signaling studies revealed the role of respiratory chain-derived reactive oxygen species for metabolic remodeling and metastasis development. The discovery of oxidative tumors in human and mice models related to chemoresistance also changed the prevalent view of dysfunctional mitochondria in cancer cells. Likewise, the influence of energy metabolism-derived oncometabolites emerged as a new means of tumor genetic regulation. The knowledge obtained on the multi-site regulation of energy metabolism in tumors was translated to cancer preclinical studies, supported by genetic proof of concept studies targeting {LDHA}, {HK}2, {PGAM}1, or {ACLY}. Here, we review those different facets of metabolic remodeling in cancer, from its diversity in physiology and pathology, to the search of the genetic determinants, the microenvironmental regulators and pharmacological modulators.},

	abstract = {When the problem of carcinoma is approached from the metabolic aspect, the first question which arises is: how does the metabolism of growing tissue differ from that of resting? The prospects of finding an answer to this question are good. Whether the mass of a given tissue is to remain constant, or, within a short period to increase many-fold, must be determined by the velocity of those processes which supply the driving forces for growth. Our task is to search for such processes and to compare their velocities in resting tissues and growing tissues.If this question is solved, then the further inquiry must be made as to whether the manner of arrangement of growing cells is manifested in their metabolism. Does the metabolism of tumors, growing in a disorganized manner, differ from the metabolism of orderly cells growing at the same rate. The hope of solving this question must be considered slight in general, and rightly so, if it is only the form-building forces which tumors lack. For of all problems of physiology, that of form is the least approachable.Yet it seems doubtful that only minute and unimportant differences should exist between the growth of young cells and those of tumors, instead of considerable physico-chemical differences. Progress in the carcinoma problem implies the adoption of the point of view involved by the latter alternative. This has been done and I shall try to show that it is the correct point of view.},

Energy metabolism is particularly important for growth and genes encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism are frequently altered in cancer cells. A genome scale metabolic model ({GEM}) is a mathematical formalization of metabolism which allows simulation and hypotheses testing of metabolic strategies. It has successfully been applied to many microorganisms and is now used to study cancer metabolism. Generic models of human metabolism have been reconstructed based on the existence of metabolic genes in the human genome. Cancer specific models of metabolism have also been generated by reducing the number of reactions in the generic model based on high throughput expression data, e.g. transcriptomics and proteomics. Targets for drugs and bio markers for diagnostics have been identified using these models. They have also been used as scaffolds for analysis of high throughput data to allow mechanistic interpretation of changes in expression. Finally, {GEMs} allow quantitative flux predictions using flux balance analysis ({FBA}). Here we critically review the requirements for successful {FBA} simulations of cancer cells and discuss the symmetry between the methods used for modeling of microbial and cancer metabolism. {GEMs} have great potential for translational research on cancer and will therefore become of increasing importance in the future.},

	abstract = {Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, {MutSigCV}, for resolving the problem. We apply {MutSigCV} to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with {DNA} replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, {MutSigCV} is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

In addition to the widely studied Warburg effect, several new key metabolic alterations in cancer have been established over the last decade, leading to the recognition that altered tumor metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Deciphering the full scope and functional implications of the dysregulated metabolism in cancer requires both the advancement of a variety of omics measurements and the advancement of computational approaches for the analysis and contextualization of the accumulated data. Encouragingly, while the metabolic network is highly interconnected and complex, it is at the same time probably the best characterized cellular network. Following, this review discusses the challenges that genome-scale modeling of cancer metabolism has been facing. We survey several recent studies demonstrating the first strides that have been done, testifying to the value of this approach in portraying a network-level view of the cancer metabolism and in identifying novel drug targets and biomarkers. Finally, we outline a few new steps that may further advance this field.},

Energy metabolism is particularly important for growth and genes encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism are frequently altered in cancer cells. A genome scale metabolic model ({GEM}) is a mathematical formalization of metabolism which allows simulation and hypotheses testing of metabolic strategies. It has successfully been applied to many microorganisms and is now used to study cancer metabolism. Generic models of human metabolism have been reconstructed based on the existence of metabolic genes in the human genome. Cancer specific models of metabolism have also been generated by reducing the number of reactions in the generic model based on high throughput expression data, e.g. transcriptomics and proteomics. Targets for drugs and bio markers for diagnostics have been identified using these models. They have also been used as scaffolds for analysis of high throughput data to allow mechanistic interpretation of changes in expression. Finally, {GEMs} allow quantitative flux predictions using flux balance analysis ({FBA}). Here we critically review the requirements for successful {FBA} simulations of cancer cells and discuss the symmetry between the methods used for modeling of microbial and cancer metabolism. {GEMs} have great potential for translational research on cancer and will therefore become of increasing importance in the future.},

The regulation of most cellular processes is consistent with the objective of growth rate maximization except for a few suboptimal processes which likely integrate more complex objectives such as coping with stressful conditions and survival. As a proof of principle by using simulations, we illustrated how calibrated {RBA} could aid rational design of strains for maximizing protein production, offering new opportunities to investigate design principles in prokaryotes and to exploit them for biotechnological applications.},

We created a generic mouse metabolic reaction ({MMR}) {GEM}, reconstructed 28 tissue-specific {GEMs} based on proteomics data, and manually curated {GEMs} for small intestine, colon, liver, and adipose tissues. We used these functional models to determine the global metabolic differences between {CONV}-R and {GF} mice. Based on gene expression data, we found that the gut microbiota affects the host amino acid ({AA}) metabolism, which leads to modifications in glutathione metabolism. To validate our predictions, we measured the level of {AAs} and N-acetylated {AAs} in the hepatic portal vein of {CONV}-R and {GF} mice. Finally, we simulated the metabolic differences between the small intestine of the {CONV}-R and {GF} mice accounting for the content of the diet and relative gene expression differences.

The high mortality rates arise from late diagnosis and the limited accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The liver is a major regulator, orchestrating the clearance of toxins, balancing glucose, lipid and amino acid uptake, managing whole-body metabolism and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Tumour onset and progression is frequently accompanied by rearrangements of metabolic pathways, leading to dysregulation of metabolism. The limitation of current therapies targeting {PLCs}, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, points towards the importance of deciphering this metabolic complexity. In this Review, we discuss the role of metabolic liver disruptions and the implications of these processes in {PLCs}, emphasizing their clinical relevance and value in early diagnosis and prognosis and as putative therapeutic targets. We also describe system biology approaches able to reconstruct the metabolic complexity of liver diseases. We also discuss whether metabolic rearrangements are a cause or consequence of {PLCs}, emphasizing the opportunity to clinically exploit the rewired metabolism. In line with this idea, we discuss circulating metabolites as promising biomarkers for {PLCs}.},

However, although most therapies are still based on antimitotic agents, which are causing wide secondary effects, there is an increasing interest for metabolic therapies that can minimize side effects. In the early 20th century, Otto Warburg revealed that cancer cells rely on the cytoplasmic fermentation of glucose to lactic acid for energy synthesis (called "Warburg effect"). Our investigations aim to reverse this effect in reprogramming cancer cells' metabolism. In this work, we present a metabolic therapy specifically targeting the activity of specific enzymes of central carbon metabolism, combining the {METABLOC} bi-therapeutic drugs combination (Alpha Lipoic Acid and Hydroxycitrate) to Metformin and Diclofenac, for treating tumors implanted in mice. Furthermore, a dynamic metabolic model describing central carbon metabolism as well as fluxes targeted by the drugs allowed to simulate tumors progression in both treated and non-treated mice, in addition to draw hypotheses on the effects of the drugs on tumor cells metabolism.

Cancer cells present in complex tumor tissues communicate with the surrounding microenvironment and develop traits which promote their growth, survival, and metastasis.

	abstract = {We develop here a novel modelling approach with the aim of closing the conceptual gap between tumour-level metabolic processes and the metabolic processes occurring in individual cancer cells. In particular, the metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma derived cell lines ({HEPG}2 cells) has been well characterized but implementations of multiscale models integrating this known metabolism have not been previously reported. We therefore extend a previously published multiscale model of vascular tumour growth, and integrate it with an experimentally verified network of central metabolism in {HEPG}2 cells. This resultant combined model links spatially heterogeneous vascular tumour growth with known metabolic networks within tumour cells and accounts for blood flow, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling and nutrient/growth factor transport within a growing tumour, as well as the movement of, and interactions between normal and cancer cells. Model simulations report for the first time, predictions of spatially resolved time courses of core metabolites in {HEPG}2 cells. These simulations can be performed at a sufficient scale to incorporate clinically relevant features of different tumour systems using reasonable computational resources. Our results predict larger than expected temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the intracellular concentrations of glucose, oxygen, lactate pyruvate, f16bp and Acetyl-{CoA}. The integrated multiscale model developed here provides an ideal quantitative framework in which to study the relationship between dosage, timing, and scheduling of anti-neoplastic agents and the physiological effects of tumour metabolism at the cellular level. Such models, therefore, have the potential to inform treatment decisions when drug response is dependent on the metabolic state of individual cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Previous studies on monocarboxylate transporters expression in prostate cancer ({PCa}) have shown that monocarboxylate transporter 2 ({MCT}2) was clearly overexpressed in prostate malignant glands, pointing it out as a putative biomarker for {PCa}. However, its localization and possible role in {PCa} cells remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that {MCT}2 localizes mainly at peroxisomes in {PCa} cells and is able to take advantage of the peroxisomal transport machinery by interacting with Pex19. We have also shown an increase in {MCT}2 expression from non-malignant to malignant cells that was directly correlated with its peroxisomal localization. Upon analysis of the expression of several peroxisomal β-oxidation proteins in {PIN} lesions and {PCa} cells from a large variety of human prostate samples, we suggest that {MCT}2 presence at peroxisomes is related to an increase in β -oxidation levels which may be crucial for malignant transformation. Our results present novel evidence that may not only contribute to the study of {PCa} development mechanisms but also pinpoint novel targets for cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {The biological fitness of microbes is largely determined by the rate with which they replicate their biomass composition. Mathematical models that maximize this balanced growth rate while accounting for mass conservation, reaction kinetics, and limits on dry mass per volume are inevitably non-linear. Here, we develop a general theory for such models, termed Growth Balance Analysis ({GBA}), which provides explicit expressions for protein concentrations, fluxes, and growth rates. These variables are functions of the concentrations of cellular components, for which we calculate marginal fitness costs and benefits that are related to metabolic control coefficients. At maximal growth rate, the net benefits of all concentrations are equal. Based solely on physicochemical constraints, {GBA} unveils fundamental quantitative principles of cellular resource allocation and growth; it accurately predicts the relationship between growth rates and ribosome concentrations in E. coli and yeast and between growth rate and dry mass density in E. coli.},

	abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models ({GSMs}) provide a comprehensive representation of cellular metabolism. {GSMs} provide a mechanistic link between cellular genotypes and metabolic phenotypes, and are thus widely used to analyze metabolism at the systems level. {GSMs} consist of hundreds or thousands of reactions. They have thus largely been analyzed with computationally efficient constraint-based methods such as flux-balance analysis, limiting their scope and phenotype prediction accuracy. Computationally more demanding but potentially more informative methods, such as kinetic and dynamic modeling, are currently limited to small or medium-sized models. Thus, it is desirable to achieve unbiased stoichiometric reductions of large-scale metabolic models to small, coarse-grained model representations that capture significant metabolic modules. Here, we review published automated and semiautomated methods used for large-scale metabolic model reduction. The top-down methods discussed provide minimal networks that retain a set of user-protected phenotypes, but may reduce the model's metabolic and phenotypic versatility. In contrast, the two bottom-up approaches reviewed retain a more unbiased set of phenotypes; at the same time, these methods require the partitioning of the {GSM} into metabolic subsystems by the user, and make strong assumptions on the subsystems' connections and their states, respectively.},

	abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have proven to be valuable resources in enhancing our understanding of metabolic networks as they encapsulate all known metabolic capabilities of the organisms from genes to proteins to their functions. However the complexity of these large metabolic networks often hinders their utility in various practical applications. Although reduced models are commonly used for modeling and in integrating experimental data, they are often inconsistent across different studies and laboratories due to different criteria and detail, which can compromise transferability of the findings and also integration of experimental data from different groups. In this study, we have developed a systematic semi-automatic approach to reduce genome-scale models into core models in a consistent and logical manner focusing on the central metabolism or subsystems of interest. The method minimizes the loss of information using an approach that combines graph-based search and optimization methods. The resulting core models are shown to be able to capture key properties of the genome-scale models and preserve consistency in terms of biomass and by-product yields, flux and concentration variability and gene essentiality. The development of these “consistently-reduced” models will help to clarify and facilitate integration of different experimental data to draw new understanding that can be directly extendable to genome-scale models.},
